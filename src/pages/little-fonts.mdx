import sample from "../res/pages/little-fonts/3x3.svg?raw"

it turns out there have been quite a few people making really *tiny* little
fonts.

## 3x3 typeface by Anders de Flon ([reference](http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-51468.html))

created in 2003 by a swedish designer and released in 2005, this typeface is
probably at the limit of legibility.

this is the entire typeface:

i've embedded [an 8x8 font](https://github.com/dhepper/font8x8) in binaries
before in cases where i wanted rudimentary text rendering without loading
external resources. in that case, characters were stored as 8 bytes, one for
each row. this 3x3 is *almost* small enough to store entire characters as
a single byte each.

<Fragment set:html={sample}/>

... though i wish it was 8.

## nanofont3x4 ([reference](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/nanofont3x4))

adding one more row improves legibility tremendously. this font could be useful
in any number of super low resolution applications. i'm thinking tiny displays
on embedded hardware, and fantasy consoles Ã  la pico-8.

## subpixel 1x5 fonts..? ([reference](https://github.com/tangmi/really-small-font))

this is where things start to get weird. assuming specific horizontal subpixel
layouts allow us to form 1x5 character blocks that end up as 3x5 subpixels.

if you double the columns to 2x5, you enter the realm of what we can now call *extremely legible*.

these millitext images are courtesy of [msarnoff.org](http://www.msarnoff.org/millitext/).
go there to see the images at their native resolution - if you have a monitor
with the correct subpixel layout you might even be able to read them.

## dotsies ([reference](https://dotsies.org/))

we're now moving out of the realm of simply minimizing the number of pixels used
to represent a character, and into the realm of *redefining* what a character
even is.

dotsies is a project that aims to optimise the latin alphabet into 1x5 pixel
columns for extreme spatial efficiency. the result is a font that looks to me
like some sort of alien language.

i recommend checking out the [dotsies website](https://dotsies.org) and trying
to read the text there; it's a fun challenge.
